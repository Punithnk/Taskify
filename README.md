# Taskify
Task management application 
Taskify — A minimal, friendly React task manager built with Vite (add, complete, delete tasks + progress tracker)
README blurb (paste near the top)

Taskify is a compact, component-driven task manager built with React and Vite. It's designed for learning and quick customization: add tasks with priority and category, mark tasks complete, delete tasks, and watch your completion progress update in real time. The project uses plain CSS for a modern, accessible UI and is easy to extend with persistence, filters, or integrations.

Suggested LICENSE

MIT — Simple, permissive license. (If you prefer another, say so and I can add a LICENSE file.)
Short CONTRIBUTING.md blurb

Prefer small commits and descriptive PRs. Run npm run lint and ensure the app builds with npm run build before opening a PR. For larger features, open an issue first to discuss.
Optional next steps I can do for you

Add the README content into README.md (I already did this previously — you reverted it; I can re-add and tailor it).
Create an MIT LICENSE file.
Add a .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE and PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.
Wire up localStorage persistence in App.jsx.
Start the dev server and capture the runtime error you were seeing earlier.
