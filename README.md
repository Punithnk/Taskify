Taskify is a compact, component-driven task manager built with React and Vite. It's designed for learning and quick customization: add tasks with priority and category, mark tasks complete, delete tasks, and watch your completion progress update in real time. The project uses plain CSS for a modern, accessible UI and is easy to extend with persistence, filters, or integrations.
